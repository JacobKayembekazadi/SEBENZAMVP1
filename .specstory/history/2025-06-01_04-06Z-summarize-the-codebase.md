    *   `forms/`: Components specifically for form elements.
    *   Feature-specific components.
*   **`pages/`**: Contains components representing different views or pages of the application. Noteworthy pages include: `Dashboard`, `Settings`, `Estimates`, `Accounting`, `Expenses`, `Calendar`, `Invoices`, `TimeTracking`, `Cases`, `ClientPortal`, `Clients`, `Messages`, `Help`, and `Documents`. There are also `NotFound` and `Index` pages.
*   **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic.
*   **`lib/`**: Utility functions and configuration files.
*   **`types/`**: TypeScript type definitions for data structures and interfaces.
*   **`styles/`**: Global styles for the application (e.g., `index.css`, `App.css`).

**UI/UX and Design:**

*   **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface tailored for legal professionals.
*   **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design for optimal viewing across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Dark Mode Support**: Ability to toggle between light and dark themes.
*   **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant components with proper ARIA labels.
*   **Consistent Styling**: Unified design language across all components.

**Security Features:**

what shoukl be added next?

---

_**Assistant**_

Given the extensive features already present in the Sebenza System, here are some areas that could be added or enhanced next, categorized for clarity:

### 1. Advanced Feature Enhancements:

*   **Workflow Automation**: Implement customizable workflows for common legal processes (e.g., client intake, document review, case progression). This could involve integrating with external services or building a robust internal system for task assignment and progress tracking.
*   **Document Generation & Templates**: While document management exists, adding features for automated document generation using predefined templates (e.g., contracts, letters, pleadings) based on case data would be highly beneficial.
*   **Conflict Checking**: A sophisticated conflict-checking system that automatically identifies potential conflicts of interest based on client, case, and party data.
*   **Client Relationship Management (CRM) Deep Dive**: Expand the CRM capabilities beyond basic contact information to include detailed communication logs, client-specific notes, and relationship history.
*   **Payment Gateway Integrations**: If not already fully implemented, integrate with more payment gateways to offer diverse payment options for clients when paying invoices.

### 2. Performance & Scalability:

*   **Caching Mechanisms**: Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data (e.g., dashboard statistics, client lists) to improve loading times and reduce database load.
*   **Database Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries, consider indexing strategies, and potentially explore database sharding or replication if anticipating very high data volumes.
*   **Code Splitting/Lazy Loading**: For large applications like this, implementing more aggressive code splitting and lazy loading of components or routes can significantly improve initial load times.

### 3. Testing & Quality Assurance:

*   **Comprehensive Test Suite Expansion**: While "running tests" is mentioned, focus on expanding unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to achieve higher code coverage and ensure stability across all features, especially for critical financial and case management modules.
*   **Performance Testing**: Conduct load and stress testing to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle a large number of users and data.
*   **Security Audits & Penetration Testing**: Given the sensitive nature of legal data, regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial to identify and address vulnerabilities.

### 4. User Experience (UX) & Accessibility Refinements:

*   **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to customize their dashboards with widgets relevant to their roles and daily tasks.
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Enhance search capabilities with more advanced filtering options across all modules (clients, cases, documents, etc.).
*   **In-App Tutorials/Onboarding**: For a comprehensive system, interactive in-app tutorials or a guided onboarding process for new users would be very helpful.
*   **Enhanced Notifications**: A more robust notification system for important updates, deadlines, and client communications.

### 5. Integration & Extensibility:

*   **API for Third-Party Integrations**: Develop a well-documented API to allow for easier integration with other legal tech tools, accounting software, or communication platforms.
*   **Email/Calendar Sync**: Deeper integration with popular email clients (e.g., Outlook, Gmail) and calendar applications for seamless scheduling and communication.

### 6. Reporting & Analytics Expansion:

*   **Customizable Report Builder**: Allow users to build their own custom reports by selecting specific data points and metrics.
*   **Predictive Analytics**: Explore incorporating predictive analytics for case outcomes or financial forecasting, if applicable and feasible with the available data.

The "next best" addition would depend on the project's current priorities, user feedback, and business goals. However, enhancing workflow automation, document generation, and expanding the test suite are often high-impact improvements for a system of this nature.
