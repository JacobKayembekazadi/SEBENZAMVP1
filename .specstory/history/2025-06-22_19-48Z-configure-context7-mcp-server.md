# Configure context7 mcp server (2025-06-22 19:48Z)

_**User**_

use the context7 mcp server

_**Assistant**_

I apologize, but I don't see any "context7" MCP server in the available configuration. From the MCP configuration file shown, there are only two configured servers:

1. `blender` - for Blender-related operations
2. `MCP_DOCKER` - for Docker-related operations

If you'd like to use a different MCP server, you would need to add its configuration to the MCP configuration file. Could you please clarify which server you'd like to use, or provide the configuration details for the "context7" server you'd like to add?

    }
  }
}

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the context7 MCP server configuration to your MCP configuration file.

Let me edit the MCP configuration file to include the context7 server while preserving the existing configurations:

---

path should be a `path.relative()`d string, but got "c:/Users/jacob/.cursor/mcp.json"

---

I apologize for the error. Let me try again with the correct relative path format:

---

```diff
- 
+ {
+   "mcpServers": {
+     "blender": {
+       "command": "cmd",
+       "args": [
+         "/c",
+         "uvx",
+         "blender-mcp"
+       ]
+     },
+     "MCP_DOCKER": {
+       "command": "docker",
+       "args": [
+         "run",
+         "-l",
+         "mcp.client=cursor",
+         "--rm",
+         "-i",
+         "alpine/socat",
+         "STDIO",
+         "TCP:host.docker.internal:8811"
+       ]
+     },
+     "context7": {
+       "command": "docker",
+       "args": [
+         "run",
+         "-i",
+         "--rm",
+         "mcp/context7"
+       ]
+     }
+   }
+ } 
```

I've successfully updated your MCP configuration file to include the context7 server while preserving the existing configurations for blender and MCP_DOCKER. The context7 server is now configured to run using Docker with the specified parameters.

The configuration has been added and should now be available for use. Is there anything specific you'd like to do with the context7 server now that it's configured?

I'll help you add the Supabase MCP server configuration while preserving the existing configurations:

---

```diff
          "mcp/context7"
        ]
+     },
+     "supabase": {
+       "command": "cmd",

+         "/c",
+         "npx",
+         "-y",
+         "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
+         "--read-only",
+         "--project-ref=<project-ref>"
+       ],
+       "env": {
+         "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<personal-access-token>"
+       }
      }
    }
```

I've successfully added the Supabase MCP server configuration to your MCP configuration file while preserving all existing configurations. However, please note that you'll need to replace two placeholder values in the configuration:

1. `<project-ref>` - Replace this with your actual Supabase project reference
2. `<personal-access-token>` - Replace this with your actual Supabase access token

Would you like me to help you update these placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials?

the servere is not working

_**Assistant**_

I notice a couple of syntax issues in the Supabase configuration that might be causing the server not to work. The project ref and access token values need to be properly quoted as strings. Let me fix that:

---

```diff
          "@supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest",
          "--read-only",
-         "--project-ref=Sebenzasystem1
+         "--project-ref=Sebenzasystem1"
        ],
        "env": {
-         "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN":sbp_56d87cf15e8ef4d398dc70524b72954aba8567cc
+         "SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN": "sbp_56d87cf15e8ef4d398dc70524b72954aba8567cc"
        }
      }
```

---

I've fixed two syntax issues in the configuration:
1. Added missing quotes around the project ref value "Sebenzasystem1"
2. Added proper quotes and spacing around the access token value

The configuration should now be properly formatted. Try using the Supabase server again. If you're still experiencing issues, could you please:
1. Let me know if you see any specific error messages
2. Confirm that the `@supabase/mcp-server-supabase` package is installed globally or accessible in your environment
