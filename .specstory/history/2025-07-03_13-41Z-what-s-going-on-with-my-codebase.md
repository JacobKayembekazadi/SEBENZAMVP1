whats going on with my codebase?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing the codebase status**

The user is looking for clarity on their codebase, potentially concerning its structure and current issues with merge conflicts. It looks like there are many deleted files in the 'backend' and 'src' directories due to unresolved merges on the 'restore-work' branch. The codebase lacks significant backend files and might not run as expected. I should provide an overview, mention the React TypeScript frontend, Node backend details, and summarize project architecture to guide the user on next steps.
**Summarizing codebase architecture**

It's important to address potential missing imports and compile errors resulting from the merge conflicts. I should give instructions on how to resolve these issues, perhaps using git restore. Additionally, I need to analyze remaining file modifications and any untracked files, especially in multiple directories like 'src/components.' The user might want a high-level overview of the codebase architecture, which includes a law firm management system with modules for clients, cases, calendars, documents, and dashboards, utilizing React 18 with TypeScript and a Node backend.</details></think>

Here’s a quick “lay of the land” and what looks unusual right now.

1. What the project is  
• Full-stack law-firm management system.  
  – Frontend: React + TypeScript (see `src/`), lots of feature-scoped components (clients, cases, documents, dashboard, etc.) and a shared ShadCN-based UI kit in `src/components/ui`.  
  – Backend: Node/Express API in `backend/` (routes for events, search, etc.).  
  – Shared architectural and product documentation lives at the repo root (`architectural_document.md`, `product_requirements_document*.md`).  
• Tech stack in code matches the spec in the architecture doc (PostgreSQL, Supabase, React Query, Tailwind, etc.).

2. Current Git status – why things look “broken”  
Your working tree is mid-merge on branch `restore-work`:

   deleted by us
   ├─ backend/api/routes/events.js  
   ├─ backend/package.json  
   ├─ backend/server.js  
   ├─ src/components/calendar/AddEventDialog.tsx  
   ├─ src/constants/eventTypes.ts  
   ├─ src/lib/api/{documents-api.ts,events-api.ts,postgresql-api.ts}  
   ├─ src/lib/auth/postgresql-auth.ts  
   └─ src/lib/types.ts  

Those files existed on the branch you’re merging *into*, but were removed (or renamed) on your branch, so Git has marked them as **conflicts**. Until you tell Git whether each deletion is intentional (keep the deletion) or accidental (restore the file), the repository is in an unresolved state and most of your build will fail (imports point to now-missing files).

There’s also one edited file not yet staged (`src/components/clients/enhanced/ClientAnalytics.tsx`) and several untracked items (`supabase/`, `.specstory/`, etc.).

3. How to get back to a consistent state  
A. Decide, file-by-file, whether you want the version from the other branch or the deletion from yours:  
   • To keep the file → `git restore --staged <file>` then `git restore <file>` (or run a 3-way merge if both sides changed).  
   • To keep the deletion → `git add <file>` (mark conflict resolved).

B. Once every conflicted path is resolved, commit the merge:  
```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge: keep/restore backend & calendar files"
```

C. Run the project again (e.g., `npm run dev` in each package) to catch any missing imports created by whichever choice you made.

4. Anything else odd?  
• `backend/`’s `package.json` is in the conflict list, so until it’s restored you can’t install or run the API.  
• Several **core shared TypeScript types and API wrappers** (everything under `src/lib/`) are conflicted. The frontend will have many red squiggles until those are back.  
• The `supabase/` directory is untracked—make sure it’s supposed to live in the repo (it may contain env-specific SQL or migrations).

5. Big-picture health check  
Aside from the merge mess, the codebase is logically organized and matches the architecture doc very closely:

Frontend  
• Pages in `src/pages/` map one-to-one to router paths.  
• Reusable dialogs (e.g., `TaskDialog.tsx`) live with their feature module.  
• React Query, Zod, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind are set up; Vite drives the build.

Backend  
• API routes in `backend/api/routes/`, server entry at `backend/server.js`.  
• PostgreSQL helpers and Supabase scripts (in `supabase/`) appear to be planned for deployment.

Next steps  
1. Finish the merge.  
2. Run `npm i` / `npm run dev` in both root and `backend/` to make sure everything compiles after the conflict resolution.  
3. Commit and push; then you can get back to feature work.

If you run into specific compile errors after the merge, feel free to share the log and we can track them down.
