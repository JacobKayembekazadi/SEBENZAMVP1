_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Looking at the Accounting page, I can see that there's already a Chart of Accounts tab with some CRUD functionality partially implemented. Let me analyze what's currently there and what needs to be completed:

Current Chart of Accounts tab functionality:
1. Basic account display with search, filter, and sorting
2. Create new account dialog
3. Edit account functionality
4. Delete account functionality
5. Toggle account status (active/inactive)
6. Import/Export dialogs
7. View account ledger and history dialogs

However, looking at the code, some things that need to be enhanced or fixed:

1. The handlers for CRUD operations are mostly there but some might need refinement
2. The form validation might need improvement
3. The error handling could be better
4. Some of the state management might need cleanup

Let me also check what linter errors need to be fixed. The errors are about form elements not having proper labels - specifically the date inputs and checkboxes need proper accessibility attributes.

I'll need to:
1. Fix the linter errors by adding proper labels/accessibility attributes
2. Ensure all CRUD operations work properly
3. Add proper form validation
4. Improve error handling
5. Make sure the UI is fully functional

Let me implement these improvements.</details></think>

I'll enhance the Chart of Accounts tab to make it fully CRUD functional and fix the linter errors. Let me implement the necessary improvements:
