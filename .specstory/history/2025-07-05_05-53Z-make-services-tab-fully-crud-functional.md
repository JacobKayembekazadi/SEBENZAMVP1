_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing CRUD implementation**

The user wants the "services" tab on the settings page to be fully CRUD functional. I need to analyze the settings page's current structure to see how I can implement this. The next step is inspecting the "src/pages/Settings.tsx" file since it seems to contain the relevant code. I'll check for any existing tabs that might be related to this functionality. Then, I can start planning how to add the CRUD operations effectively.</details></think>

Read file: src/pages/Settings.tsx
