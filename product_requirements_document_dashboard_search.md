# Product Requirements Document: Dashboard Actionability & Global Search

## 1. Feature Name: Dashboard Actionability & Global Search

**Feature Type:** Core UX Enhancement  
**Target Release:** Q2 2024  
**Priority:** High  
**Stakeholders:** All Sebenza System Users (Attorneys, Paralegals, Administrative Staff, Partners)  

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The current Sebenza Dashboard provides an overview, but key actions and information retrieval are not as immediate or intuitive as they could be.

* **For Actions:** Users identify tasks or needs on the dashboard (e.g., "unbilled time," "expenses") but lack direct, integrated pathways to initiate the corresponding workflows (e.g., creating an invoice, adding an expense, managing financial connections). This forces them to navigate via the sidebar, adding unnecessary clicks and friction.
* **For Information Retrieval:** Users currently lack a centralized, efficient way to quickly find specific clients, cases, documents, or other critical information across the entire application without knowing which section it resides in. This leads to wasted time and frustration when searching for information.

This feature aims to transform the dashboard into a highly actionable hub and introduce a ubiquitous search capability, significantly enhancing efficiency and user experience for legal professionals.

### Impact Analysis
- **Time Savings**: Estimated 5-10 minutes saved per user per day through improved navigation and search
- **User Satisfaction**: Direct access to actions reduces cognitive load and improves workflow efficiency
- **Competitive Advantage**: Modern search capabilities align with user expectations from consumer applications

## 3. User Stories

### Global Search
* **As a lawyer/paralegal**, I want to **quickly search for clients, cases, documents, time entries, or invoices from anywhere in the application** (specifically the dashboard header) so I can immediately access relevant information without navigating through multiple sections.
* **As a firm user**, I want the search results to be **organized by entity type** (e.g., "Clients", "Cases", "Documents") so I can easily distinguish and locate the information I'm looking for.
* **As a firm user**, I want the search bar to **provide real-time suggestions as I type** so I can quickly refine my query and find matches faster.
* **As a power user**, I want to **use keyboard shortcuts** (e.g., Cmd/Ctrl + K) to quickly access the search bar from anywhere in the application.
* **As a mobile user**, I want the search functionality to be **touch-optimized** with appropriate input methods for smaller screens.

### Dashboard Action Buttons
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Create Invoice" button on the Dashboard's "Unbilled Time" section and be **taken directly to the invoice creation page**, pre-populated or ready for input, so I can bill for unbilled time efficiently.
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Add Client" button on the Dashboard's "Add Your Client" card and be **taken directly to the client creation page**, so I can onboard new clients quickly.
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Create Quote" button on the Dashboard's "Secure a New Deal" card and be **taken directly to the estimates creation page**, so I can generate proposals promptly.
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Add Expense" button on the Dashboard's "Track Your Spending" card and be **taken directly to the expense creation page**, so I can log new expenses without delay.
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Connect Bank" button on the Dashboard's "Connect Bank Account" card and be **taken directly to the bank connection setup page** (within the Accounting section) so I can link financial accounts for automated tracking.
* **As a firm user**, I want to click the "Setup Payments" button on the Dashboard's "Payment Gateway" card and be **taken directly to the payment gateways configuration page** (within Settings) so I can set up online payment processing for my firm.
